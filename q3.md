## Q3: Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology 

Agile project management is an approach to software development that follows four basic principles which focus on individuals and their interactions, creating working software, integrating the stakeholder in the development process and the ability to dynamically adjust to and evolve with changing needs and conditions. Generally speaking this philosophy manifests itself practically by implementing:
 - User stories and epics: In keeping with the Agile philosophy of placing people first user stories are ways to make tangible the features and components of the software being developed. They are vignettes to describe the ways users will interact with with the product. This illustrates the value the features will provide in a meaningful way. Similarly, epics describe features and products in larger, more involved scope.
 - Smaller, self-organizing teams tackling targeted pieces of larger problems in shorter increments of time. These teams are generally heterogeneous and can contain product owners, developers and product testers. 
 - Frequent deliveries of working software. 
 - Frequent review of both the product and the process to maximize productivity, quality of product and satisfaction of stakeholders. This can take the form of daily standups (or daily scrum if using scrum framework) which are shared personal accounts of develpment process as well as cyclical and iterative reviews of sprints and features. 
- frequent and direct communication between individuals, teams and stakeholders to help define goals, maximize productivity and ensure quality of product. 
- An environment that welcomes change and evoloution of design as it promotes value and competetiveness for the stakeholder. 


There are a number of frameworks which provide structured implementation plans to facilitate Agile development. Such frameworks include Crystal Clear, Kanban, Scrum and Extreme Programming. A projects framework is typically chosen to fit its unique needs and structure while staying true to the overall guiding tenets and principles of Agile methodology.
