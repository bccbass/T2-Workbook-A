## Q2: Identify a database management system (DBMS) commonly used in web applications (including Flask) and discuss the pros and cons of this database

One popular database management system commonly used in web applications is PostgreSQL. It is open sourced and has over thirty-five years of support and development by an active community. Because of this PostgresQL enjoys frequent updates, added features and bug fixes. The open-source community has also developed many tools, libraries and frameworks which enable integration into many languages and project environments. For example, when implementing PostgreSQL in a web application environment utilizing Python and Flask available frameworks and libraries include AlchemySQL, Marshmallow and psycopg. This many resources available allow for easy integration of the database into numerous web app environments. Although PostgreSQL supports no SQL databases it is primarily aimed towards managing SQL databases - a database structure that has been around for nearly fifty years. This long history has created ample documentation and a set of tried and tested best practices to creating robust and efficient databases. PostgreSQL supports a great many data types including geolocation, geospatial as well user user defined types and creation of functions. PostgerSQL is adept at promoting data integrity and durability, implementing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, write-ahead logging (WAL) and point-in-time recovery. DDL, DML and DQL in PostgreSQL extremely straightforward using many directives that more closely resemble plain english than code.

Because PostgreSQL is designed to scale vertically it can make large and quickly growing projects difficult or costly to keep up with growth. Vertical scaling requires increasing storage, RAM and CPU capabilities in line with a project growth - this can become costly and require frequent upgrade of cloud hosting packages. Querying on larger PostgreSQL projects can also become memory intensive and result in slower results, especially with more complex queries with complicated joins. As PostgreSQL is tailored to SQL databases it may not be the best choice for NoSQL databases due to limited NoSQL features and support.
