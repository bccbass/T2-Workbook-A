## Q2: Identify a database management system (DBMS) commonly used in web applications (including Flask) and discuss the pros and cons of this database





********CHANGE FORMAT TO BULLET POINTS**********
One popular database management system commonly used in web applications is PostgreSQL. It is open sourced and has over thirty-five years of support and development by an active community. Because of this PostgresQL enjoys frequent updates, added features and bug fixes. The open-source community has also developed extensive tools, libraries and frameworks which enable integration into many languages and project environments. These resources available allow for easy integration of the database into numerous web app environments. Although PostgreSQL does support NoSQL databases it is primarily aimed towards managing SQL databases - a database structure that was created in the early 1970's. This long history has created ample documentation and a set of tried and tested best practices for creating robust and efficient databases. PostgreSQL supports a great many data types including geolocation, geospatial as well as user defined data types and functions. PostgerSQL is adept at promoting data integrity and durability, implementing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, write-ahead logging (WAL) and point-in-time recovery. DDL, DML and DQL in PostgreSQL are extremely straightforward using directives that more closely resemble plain english than code. Because PostgreSQL is primarily designed for SQL databases it promotes well defined relational data structures that are strongly typed, with many optional contraints and validations with aim towards data integrity and robustness.

Because PostgreSQL is designed to scale vertically it can make large and quickly growing projects difficult or costly to keep up with growth. Vertical scaling requires uprgrading storage, RAM and CPU capabilities in line with a projects growth - this can become costly and require frequent adjustment to cloud hosting packages. Querying on larger PostgreSQL projects can also become memory intensive and result in slower results, especially with more complex queries with complicated joins. As PostgreSQL is tailored to SQL databases it is generally not the best choice for NoSQL databases due to limited NoSQL features and support.
