## Q1: Describe the architecture of a typical Flask application

The typical Flask application architecture aims to facilitate interactions between end-users and a programs logic and data. The application is designed to handle incoming user requests and serve a response of data. This response can be of different data types, including JSON objects or html templates. It implements routes paired with corresponding logic needed to respond with the requested data. 

Databases can be connected to a Flask application with logic written to facilitate full CRUD operations. A typical RESTful flask application interacts with a targeted database connected via modules such as SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow and psycopg. An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) such as SQLAlchemy is implemented to interface between Flask and the connected database, making interactions more seamless. ORM's generally use Models within the Flask app to structure database tables and implement instances of these models to add records to a database. 

User routes are constructed to interact with the database and in the most simple format will consist of a main index page, and a route to list an overview of all records from a targeted table. This route usually shares the same name as the table it is displaying. For instance a music store might list available instruments for sale with a route ```/instruments```. A user can select a record from this index to show more details pertaining to it, typically structured as ```table/record_id```. In our example the route might be ```/instruments/<instrument_id>```. These are the most basic elements of a read-only application. If an application implements create, update and delete functionality there will be routes for each of these actions with corresponding logic necessary for its implementation:
- The create route is constructed with a post request sent to the tables index route ```/table```. 
- An update is constructed with a put or patch request sent to the ```table/record_id``` route and the corresponding handler facilitates editing the record within its specified parameters and updating the correct record within the database. Although this can be accomplished with either a put or patch request the standard approach of construction uses the put request to re-write the entire record; a put request is generally more efficient and less prone to data errors.
- Deleting records is accomplished with a delete request to the ```table/record_id``` route with handler logic to drop the corresponding record from the database. 

If the application is web based it will implement HTML templates to render requested data. These templates integrate Python logic within an HTML structure so data can be displayed on a template framework. This eliminates the need for individual HTML pages for each instance of a record or table, instead injecting the data into a form template. 

Additionally, user authentication and authorization can be implemented if there are private or individualized concerns involved with the application. Third party packages can be imported to implement hashing and verification protocols. 

Although flask applications can take many forms to accomplish varied objectives this is just one example of a RESTful flask application geared towards a user interacting with data contained in a connected database.
