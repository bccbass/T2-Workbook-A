## Q1: Describe the architecture of a typical Flask application

The typical Flask application architecture aims to handle incoming user requests and serve requested data of different types such as JSON objects or html pages. It implements routes with corresponding logic needed to respond with the requested data. Databases can be connected to an application and logic written to facilitate full CRUD operations. A typical RESTful flask application interacts with a targeted database connected via modules such as SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow and psycopg. User routes are constructed to interact with the database and in the most simple format will consist of a project index page, and a route to list an overview of all data from requested table. This route usually shares the same name as the table it is displaying. For instance a music store might list available instruments for sale as ```/instruments```. A user can typically select a record from this index to show more details pertaining to this record, typically structured as ```table/record_id```. In our example the route might be ```/instruments/<instrument_id>```. These are the most basic elements of a read-only application. If an application implements create, update and delete functionality there will be routes for each of these actions with corresponding logic necessary for its implementation:
- The create route is initiated with a post request sent to the tables index route ```/table```. 
- An update is initiated with a put or patch request sent to the ```table/record_id``` route and the corresponding handler facilitates editing the record within its specified parameters and updating the correct record within the database. 
- Deleting records is accomplished through sending a delete request to the ```table/record_id``` route and the handler logic is executed to drop the corresponding record from the database. 

Although flask applications can take many forms to accomplish varied objectives this is just one example of a RESTful flask application geared towards a user interacting with data contained in a connected database.
