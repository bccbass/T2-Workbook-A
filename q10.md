## Q10: Describe the integrity aspects of the relational database model. Your description should include information about the types of data integrity and how they can be enforced in a relational database.


In the relational database model data integrity is of utmost concern. It is imperative to keep the data sanitized and the database optimized and free of unforeseen errors. There are many tools provided to ensure the integrity of a database including strongly typed schemas, attribute constraints and normalization.  

Relational database attributes are strongly typed: when defining schemas a data type must be given. This is the first layer to ensuring data integrity by clearly defining expected and allowed data types.  

Attribute constraints help sanitize data by requring specified criteria are met, safeguarding against unforeseen database and logical errors. There are many constraints a user can implement including string length parameters, integer value and range and requiring a value be present (not null) or unique. 

Primary and Foreign key constraints define the relational structures of a database. A primary key must be both unique and not null - thus these are implicit constraints when specifying a primary key. Foreign key constraints reference a separate tables primary key - another convention that ensures the expected behavior from a relational model. 

Assigning a foreign keys behavior on delete and update is one more layer to ensuring data integrity. A user may specify what happens to the referenced data when a record is deleted or updated. Options include ```ON DELETE CASCADE``` , ```ON DELETE NULL```  and ```RESTRICT``` which will prevent any further alteration of the referenced data. 

Implementing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for all transactions safefuards against corrupted data due to failed transactions. Atomicity ensures transactions are either completely executed or not executed at all. Consistency checks that all data are adhering to all definted expectations and parameters. Isolation ensures transactions remain isolated from one another and therefore cannot interact with in-progress transactions. And lastly durability means that once a transaction is committed and a success message sent it has been stored in the system permanently, even if a hardware failure occurs directly after. 

Finally, data normalization is one of the most integral steps to ensuring data integrity and performance. Normalization is a process that aims to structure (or restructure) a data base according to a proscribed set of steps with a key focus to reducing duplication. Data duplication creates a significant threat to data integrity by increasing the likelihood of data inconsistencies. Additionally, it can cause performance issues by requiring the same data to be updated or deleted in multiple tables and inflate database size by storing redundant data in multiple locations. The normalization process steps through three main normal forms to systematically restructure a database, reducing redundancy and promoting logical and efficient data structures.
