## Q9: Describe the structural aspects of the relational database model. Your description should include information about the structure in which data is stored and how relations are represented in that structure  
</br>

A relational database is a collection of related tables, comprised of columns(attributes) and rows(records or tuples). Because a database aims to represent complex real-world entities with many interwoven relations it is necessary to model a database logically and thoroughly before physically implementing it. One tool to examine and create relational structures is the entity relationship diagram or ERD. An ERD aims to plot out all attributes of a collection of entities and define how they relate to each other. These relationships can help reveal necessary additional tables and structure more complex relations efficiently. Each table must have a unique name and may specify an attribute as a primary key. This primary key value must be unique to the column to which it belongs (eg. a customer id or product model number). Tables can link to other tables by specifying an attribute as a foreign key. This foreign key generally references another tables unique primary key as an identifier. Database relationships can be described by the number of possible connections they may have to each other such as zero, zero or one, zero or many, one or many, many etc. This can be illustrated in the relationship between a director and a film: a director can direct many films, but generally a film only has one director - this relationship would be described as one to many. It is important to note that relational databases do not support many to many relationships thus a new joining table must be implemented to achieve the proper data structures. Once a database model has been thoroughly conceived a physical database can then be constructed.  Relational Databases use schemas to define entities and the relationships between them and the commands used for this process are aptly referred to as  Data Definition Language (DDL). Within these schemas column names and their allowed data types are defined, primary and foreign keys are designated and the relationships between tables are made clear. Schemas also offer further functionality such as unique serialization for identification of attributes or date/time objects.
