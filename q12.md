## Q12: Conduct research into a web application (app) and answer the following parts: 
- a. List and describe the software used by the app.
- b. Describe the hardware used to host the app.
- c. Describe the interaction of technologies within the app
- d. Describe the way data is structured within the app
- e. Identify entities which must be tracked by the app
- f. Identify the relationships and associations between the entities you have identified in part (e)
- g. Design a schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) appropriate for the database of this website (assuming a relational database model) 

### **Reddit**
- A) Reddit backend is largely written in Python using the Pylon framework. PostgreSQL is used for the backend database and SQLAlchemy, Memcached, RabbitMQ, HAProxy, mcrouter, and cassandra are utilized for further functionality. The Reddit frontend logic is handled by a JavaScript/React/Redux/Node stack as well as HTML and CSS. Authentication is handled by an integrated Google Identity OAuth and JWT's. Hashing of sensitive data is accomplished with Bcrypt.


- B) The hardware utilized to host Reddit consists mainly of servers for handling requests and business logic, routers for networking, load balancers to distribute large traffic volumes equally across physical resources and a vast storage infrastructure to accommodate physical data bases. Reddit servers also require large and robust RAM configurations to accommodate heavy usage of Memcached functionality. In 2009 Reddit migrated to Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing their vast data centers which implement specialized and proprietary hardware configurations.


- C) In a typical Reddit user interaction an end user will access Reddit via a client (mobile app or web browser), sign-in with authentication handled by Google Identity Services and request a resource sent via HTTPS. If authentication is successful a request is sent to the backend API via a route handled by Pylon/Python. Any database CRUD actions will then be handled by SQLAlchemy as well as Memcached, a key-value data caching structure heavily utilized by Reddit. This cache receives over 800,000 get requests per second and is stored in RAM instead of on disk. The backend API then serves a response to the frontend, usually in JSON format. The frontend will take this response and update or construct a new view using HTML, CSS, React and Javascript which is then returned and rendered by the client. Each request/response cycle is atomic, with authentication verification (included in HTTPS Headers) for each interaction. 

- D) Earlier versions of Reddit utilized an Entity–attribute–value model that used two tables per entity (thing table and data table, eg. <entity>_thing & <entity>_data) . It is possible they have completely restructured their data model since, but in examining the Reddit Repository which was current as of 2017(before being made private) remnants of the EAV structure persisted. The data model implemented as of this date is highly complex and utilizes many model/class methods to implement functionality that would traditionally be performed by PostgreSQL DQL and DML. The 'things' table stores attributes of up/down votes, type and creation date. The data table stores three main attributes: thing id, key and value. Every 'thing' record has a corresponding 'data' record. Every tracked entity is utilizes these two tables and may contain multiple associated records to store all data relevant. Additionally relationships between entities are structured in this same manner as traditional SQL joins are near impossible with this data structure. It is possible this key/value data structure was implemented to correspond with a heavy reliance on Memcached, also key/value structured. In researching the reasoning behind this data structure strengths outlined were faster and less complicated maintenance, development and deployment. Weaknesses mentioned were more difficult data constraints and validation, and limited availability of the usual tools and strengths of a relational database. These shortcomings were ameliorated at the application level.

- E) The main entities Reddit must track are Subreddits (different areas of interest on the Reddit site), Posts (The individual instances of content that appear on subreddits), comments (On posts, and nested under other comments), karma, bans (individuals and subreddits who have privileges revoked), blocked users (users blocked only from particular subreddits for rule violations) awards/trophies, badges, subscriptions, ads, messages, rule sets, subreddit moderators and users. Additionally, due to Reddit's legacy use of an Entity–attribute–value model relationships may also still tracked as entities, as opposed to being defined within models as in most relational databases. 


- F) Relationships and associations between Reddit entities are likely many and labyrinthine. A possible list of entity relationships and associations: 
    - Users can be related to banned users, blocked users, comments, messages, moderators, submissions and subreddit subscriptions. They can also be associated with awards/trophies, badges and karma
    - Subreddits can be related to subreddit subscriptions, banned subreddits, blocked users, rules and submissions
    - Subreddit subscriptions are related to users and subreddits
    - Awards/trophies are related to to users
    - Badges are related to users and associated with subreddits
    - Posts can be related to subreddits, users, trophies/awards and associated with comments, karma and ads
    - Direct Messages are related to users and associated with users
    - Comments are related to users and can be associated with both posts and other comments.
    - Ads might be associated with subreddits and users depending on how they are targeted and implemented

- G) A generalized ERD of the relationships contained the Reddit database might broadly resemble this structure:
