## Q12: Conduct research into a web application (app) and answer the following parts: 
- a. List and describe the software used by the app.
- b. Describe the hardware used to host the app.
- c. Describe the interaction of technologies within the app
- d. Describe the way data is structured within the app
- e. Identify entities which must be tracked by the app
- f. Identify the relationships and associations between the entities you have identified in part (e)
- g. Design a schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) appropriate for the database of this website (assuming a relational database model)	

### Reddit
- A) Reddit is largely written in Python using the Pylon framework. PostgreSQL is used for the backend database and implements RabbitMQ, HAProxy, mcrouter, cassandra and memcached for further functionality. Reddits front-end logic is handled by a JavaScript/React/Redux/Node stack as well as HTML and CSS. Authentication is handled by an integrated Google Identity OAuth and JWT's.


- B) The hardware utilized to host Reddit consists mainly of servers for handling requests and business logic, routers for networking, load balancers to distribute large traffic volumes equally across physical resources and a vast storage infrastructure to store physical data bases. In 2009 Reddit migrated to Amazon Web Services (AWS) whose server hardware is powered by AWS EC2 server instances with processor configurations powered by Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC, Core i7 or Amazons propietary Graviton2/Graviton3 processors. AWS S3 Storage hardware options include solid-state drives, hard-disk drives and other technologies promoting performance and durability. Networking infrastructure for data transfer is generally supplied by companies Cisco, Jupiter Networks and Arista Networks. The AWS load balancer utilizes Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to evenly distribute traffic evenly across all the AWS resources.


- C) In a typical Reddit user interaction an end user will access Reddit via a client (mobile app or web browser), sign-in with authentication handled by Google Identity Services and request a resource sent via HTTPS. If authentication is succesful a request is sent to the backend API via a route handled by Pylon/Python. Any database CRUD actions will then be handled by SQLAlchemy as well as Memcached, a key-value data caching structure heavily utizlied by Reddit to store their large 'Thing' database. This cache receives over 800,000 get requests per second and is stored in RAM instead of on disk. The backend API then serves a response to the frontend, usually in JSON format. The frontend will take this response and update or construct a new view using HTML, CSS, React and Javascript which is then sent back to the user where it is rendered by the client.

- D) In the early days of Reddit the database  was constructed with a traditional SQL structure with highly organized tables joined by foreign/primary key relationships. Co-founder Steve Huffman described the early data structure as impractical and difficult to scale. Every new feature would require a schema update, backups using replication were painful and deployment complex. Early on Reddit switched to an open-schema approach. Its data structure is reffered to 'The Thing' internally and consists of only two tables - 'things' and 'data'. All entities in Reddit are considered things; users, posts, comments, subreddits, etc.. The 'things' table stores attributes of up/down votes, type and creation date. The data table stores three attributes: thing id, key and value. Every 'thing' record has a corresponding 'data' record, and every entity is stored in this way. The upside to this is that maintenance, development and deployment is fast and less complicated. The downside is that data constraints and validation are more difficult, and all of the usual tools of a relational database are limited. Most of these shortcomings are ameliorated on the application level.

- E) The main entities Reddit must track are Subreddits (different areas of interest on the Reddit site), Posts (The individual instances of content that appear on subreddits), comments (on individual posts), bans (individuals and subreddits who have privileges revoked), awards/trophies, ads, moderators and users. Additionally, due to Reddit's legacy use of an Entity–attribute–value model relationships are most likely still tracked as entities, as opposed to being defined within models like they are in most relational databases. 

- F) The relationships of entites on Reddit numerous as virtually all 'things' interact with each other. A posts belong to a subreddit in a one to many relationship. Comments belong to a post in a one to many relationship. Users are assocated with comments in a one to many relationship. Moderator entities can be associated with a key of a subreddit and a value of a user_id in order to associate a user as a moderator to a subreddit.
