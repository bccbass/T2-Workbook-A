## Q12: Conduct research into a web application (app) and answer the following parts: 
- a. List and describe the software used by the app.
- b. Describe the hardware used to host the app.
- c. Describe the interaction of technologies within the app
- d. Describe the way data is structured within the app
- e. Identify entities which must be tracked by the app
- f. Identify the relationships and associations between the entities you have identified in part (e)
- g. Design a schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) appropriate for the database of this website (assuming a relational database model)	

### Reddit
- A) Reddit was originally written in the Lisp language, but in 2005 the application was rewritten in Python. Beginning in 2008 the majority of Reddits codebase was open source and available on GitHub, but in 2017 the company archived the repository and proceeded to roll out a new version of the application. Until this point the application had been written in Python and uses both Pylon and Flask frameworks. PostgreSQL is used for the backend database and relie on RabbitMQ, HAProxy, mcrouter, cassandra and memcached. Currently the business logic concerning serving json data from the database is handled by the legacy Python application and much of the front-end logic has been handed off to a JavaScript/React/Redux stack with HTML, CSS and the JQUERY framework. 

- B) The hardware utilized to host Reddit consists mainly of servers for handling requests and business logic, routers for networking and solid state drives or hard disk drives to store physical data bases. In 2009 Reddit migrated to Amazon Web Services (AWS) whose hardware infrastructure is expansive, with data centers located across the globe. The server hardware is powered by AWS EC2 server instances with processor configurations powered by Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC, Core i7 or Amazons propietary Graviton2/Graviton3 processors. AWS Storage hardware options include solid-state drives, hard-disk drives and other technologies promoting performance and durability. Networking infrastructure for data transfer is generally supplied by companies Cisco, Jupiter Networks and Arista Networks. 


- C) The overall interaction of technology within reddit is an intersection between software and hardware. Broadly speaking, an end user will access Reddit via a client (mobile app or web browser). The user will request a resource from Reddit and this request will be physically routed by networking hardware to reddits servers, where server routing and logic will be handled. If the user has proper permissions to access the resource (verified by app side business logic) the server will then respond to the request with a data payload of requested resource. This data payload is the result of the server querying the physical database to locate the requested data which is then returned to the client. The user may interact with this resource vis a vis upvotes/downvotes, creating/editing/deleting posts, comments etc.. Each of these interactions will be authorized where applicable and sent as atomic actions to the appropriate server route with specified methods attached. Requests that successfully create, update or delete resources will again be handled by logic on the server in order to interact with the physical database accordingly and respond appropriately.  


- D) With an expansive monolith such as Reddit one might think the data structures to be labrynthine and over wrought. And in deed, until 2009 they were. Co-founder Steve Huffman described the early, highly organized, data structure as impractical and difficult to scale. Every feature would require a schema update, backups using replication was painful and deployment complex. Upon switching to an open-schema approach the data structure consisted of two tables - 'things' and 'data'. All entities in Reddit are considered 'things'; users, links, comments, subreddits, etc.. They share common attributes of up/down votes, type and creation date. The data table stores three attributes: thing id, key and value. Every 'thing' record has a corresponding 'data' record, and every type of data is stored in this way, including relationships. The upside to this is that maintenance, development and deployment is straightforward. The downside is that constraints and validation are more difficult, and querying with more complicated filters and other advantages of a relational database are limited. Much of these shortcomings are ameliorated on the application level, utilizing extensive memcaching.

- E) Although Reddit approaches different entities homogenously, they must still be tracked and their types must be specified. The main entities being tracked are Subreddits (different areas of interest on the Reddit site), Posts (The individual instances of content that appear on subreddits), comments (on individual posts), moderators and users. Additionally, due to reddits open-schema data structure other entities must tracked as well, most notably the relationships between all of the 'things' contained within the database. 

- F) The relationships of entites are many as virtually all 'things' interact with each other. A posts belong to a subreddit in a one to many relationship. Comments belong to a post in a one to many relationship. Users are assocated with comments in a one to many relationship. Moderator entities can be associated with a key of a subreddit and a value of a user_id in order to associate a user as a moderator to a subreddit.
