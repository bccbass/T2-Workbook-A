## Q8: Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data and how they can be met for the project

As the ACME Corporation is a large organization with an annual turnover over 3 million dollars the Project must adhere to Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), the cornerstone protection of the Australian Privacy Act of 1988. The guidelines that can be incorporated into the ACME app to ensure compliance are clearly delineated and include:
- Managing personal information collected from users in an open and transparent manner and providing a clear Privacy Policy available for all users. (APP 1)
- Providing an option for pseudonymous registration if users do not want to identify themselves. (APP 2)  
- Ensuring that the app will not store or utilize any information collected passively (APP 4)
- Providing users the ability to opt-out of direct marketing and ensure this option is honored (APP 7)
- Collecting and storing all provided information responsibly and securely to guard against any breaches of personal information, malicious or otherwise. (APP 11)

These are the minimum obligations that must be met to ensure legal compliance with regard to user data in the current iteration of the App. It is important to keep front of mind that ACME's legal obligations must be revisited with every new iteration of the App and feature release to ensure continual legal compliance.
