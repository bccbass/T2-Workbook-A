## Q6: Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security and how they relate to the project

As the new ACME app will require robust system security to protect user data and guard against malicious attacks such as sql injections and directory traversal. The project will require secure user accounts and protected administrator routes. A User database model will be created to manage authorization and authentication. Authentication is the first step to securing our app and can be implemented with session or JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. In session based authentication the server creates a new session after successful login which is stored in both the database and the users client as a cookie. Every subsequent client request will include the cookie which is compared to the session stored with that user. This method has drawbacks in that it is more difficult to scale as it requires more resources to store the session and continually validate requests on the server side. As ACME is already large and continually growing, and the app will include mobile versions a more suitable approach would be JWT based authentication. In JWT based authentication the server creates a token with a header, payload and signature secret which is sent to the client and stored locally. This token is included in the HTTPS header for each request to authenticate and detect in-transit tampering. Authentication best practices rely on strong user passwords which should always be hashed and salted before adding to the database session and committed. Authorization roles are created to ensure administrator routes are protected from general use. Care is taken in how they are stored and accessed in the database to protect them from malicious attacks and code injections. CSRF tokens will be implemented to guard against cross-site request forgery. Lastly, the app should only be served securely over HTTPS to protect data transmitted between the client and server.
