## Q6: Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security and how they relate to the project

As the new ACME app will require secure user accounts and protected administrator routes robust system security must be implemented. A User database model will be created to manage authorization and authentication. Authentication is the first step to securing our app and generally can be implemented with session or JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. In session based authentication the server creates a new session after successful login which is stored in both the database and the users client as a cookie. Every subsequent client request will include the cookie which is compared to the session stored with that user. This method has drawbacks in that it is more difficult to scale as it requires more resources to store the session and continually validate requests on the server side. As ACME is already large and continually growing, and the app will include mobile versions a more suitable approach would be JWT based authentication. In JWT based authentication the server creates a token with a header, payload and signature secret which is sent to the client and stored locally. This token is included in the HTTPS header for each request to authenticate and detect in-transit tampering. Authentication best practices rely on strong user passwords which should always be hashed and salted before adding to the database session and committed. Authorization roles are created to ensure administrator routes are protected from general use. Care is taken in how they are stored and accessed in the database to protect them from malicious attacks and code injections. CSRF tokens will be implemented to guard against cross-site request forgery. Lastly, the app should only be served securely over HTTPS to protect data transmitted between the client and server.

Storing user names/passwrods - passwords should always be hashed before they are commited to the physical data base. This ensures greater security for the user and their data as these hashes are one-way encrypted and virtually impossible to decode. Using sessions is another way to give greater control to the app to manage who is logged in to the app and control to log them out if need be. 




 XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. Jinja2 for validations****


 CSRF Protection
 
Cross-Site Request Forgery or CSRF is an attack that uses the victimâ€™s credentials to perform undesired actions on behalf of the victim. This vulnerability can become more severe if chained with XSS or Mis-Configured CORS, etc.
 
 
By default, the flask framework has no CSRF protection but we can use Flask-WTF extension to enable the CSRF protection. Below is an example of how CSRF protection can be enabled.
