THE PROJECT

As flask is

Storing user names/passwrods - passwords should always be hashed before they are commited to the physical data base. This ensures greater security for the user and their data as these hashes are one-way encrypted and virtually impossible to decode. Using sessions is another way to give greater control to the app to manage who is logged in to the app and control to log them out if need be. 




 XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. Jinja2 for validations****


 CSRF Protection
 
Cross-Site Request Forgery or CSRF is an attack that uses the victimâ€™s credentials to perform undesired actions on behalf of the victim. This vulnerability can become more severe if chained with XSS or Mis-Configured CORS, etc.
 
 
By default, the flask framework has no CSRF protection but we can use Flask-WTF extension to enable the CSRF protection. Below is an example of how CSRF protection can be enabled.
