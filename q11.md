## Q11: Describe the manipulative aspects of the relational database model. Your description should include information about the ways in which data is manipulated (added, removed, changed, and retrieved) in a relational database.  
</br>

Relational Databases offer extensive functionality to manipulate and query the data held within them. The commands used to manipulate the data are referred to as Data Manipulation Language or DML. Using DML commands in concert with one another provide limitless ways to access and manipulate singular or multiple records simultaneously. There are four main DML commands which are:
- ```INSERT```: Insert facilitates the creation of new rows within a table. A common example of an insert command might look something like:
    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO <your_table> (attribute_1, attribute_2) VALUES (your_new_data_1,    your_new_data_2);
    ```
- ```SELECT```: The select statement is used to query and filter data from the database. There are a plethora of ways to filter and group data queries using conditional expressions, subqueries, sorting, grouping, filtering and joining of multiple tables. Many DBMS's also provide functionality to operate on data within a table including operations such addition, average, count, minimum and maximum. The methods available to be combined with the ```SELECT``` statement are limitless and powerful but a simple select statement might look something like this: 
    ```SQL
    SELECT attribute_1, attribute_2 FROM your_table WHERE attribute_1 = desired_condition;
    ```
- ```UPDATE```: The update keyword is used to edit and update data within a table. Typically the command declares a table it would like to update, defines the attribute within it to be updated and a new value for that attribute and finally a conditional clause to filter the precise data to be updated. If no conditional clause is given it will update all rows in the table. An update command may look something like: 
    ```SQL
    UPDATE <table_name>
    SET <attribute_name> = new_value
    WHERE unique_instance_ID = desired_target_ID;
    ```
- ```DELETE```: Delete is used to remove a row or rows of data. Like the update keyword it specifies a table and generally uses a filtering where clause to target the desired data to be deleted. If no conditional filter is applied it will delete all rows from the table. The syntax might look something like: 
    ```SQL
    DELETE FROM <your_table_name>
    WHERE <desired_condition_is_met>;
    ```
