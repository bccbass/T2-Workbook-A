## Q4: Provide an overview and description of a standard source control workflow
There are many popular source control workflows software development projects can implement. Choosing the correct workflow largely depends on the nature, size and needs of the project at hand. One workflow that is particularly well suited for larger projects with many teams that may not be sharing the same physical location is Feature Branch Workflow. This approach implements feature branches to encapsulate development, leaving the main branch untouched during development. The feature branch also allows for thorough code review by teams before merging it into a main branch. It relies on feaures of both Git source control and external repository management platforms such as Bitbucket or Github for staging, committing, pushing, merging, rebasing and submitting pull requests. Benefits of this approach include leveraging pull requests via a repository management system for teams to review and assess code before merging. The pull request also acts a means of gatekeeping merges to ensure the Main branch only ever contains working code. A standard Feature Branch workflow cycle might look something like this:
- A developer clones the main code repository to their local working machine.
- Devoloper creates a new, descriptively named, feature branch and sets git upstream to the remote feature branch. This allows for code back-up and collaboration without disturbing the main branch. 
- Developer will work on planned feature, going through the standard stage, commit, push cycles until the feature is complete.
- At this stage a pull request for the feature branch is submitted.
- The pull request will be reviewed by team mates, commented on and either approved or have revisions requested. If revisions are required the developer will make them locally and push to the feature branch, in turn updating the pull request with revisions. 
- Once the pull request is approved the feature branch will be merged into the main branch. If merge conflicts occur they will need to be addressed fully for the merge to be successful. 
- After successful merge the feature branch will be deleted to keep the repository well organized and with optimized performance.
- The process then starts over again.
