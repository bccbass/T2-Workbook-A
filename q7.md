## Q7: Discuss common methods of protecting information and data and how you would apply them to the project

To secure data on the new ACME project many security vulnerabilities must be anticipated. Authentication will be handled by flask_JWT and used to generate and manage authentication tokens and verify user requests. BCrypt will be used to encrypt sensitive information such as passwords before they are added to the database session and committed to the database. It is imperative that no un-hashed password is to be stored at any time. Rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks would be implemented via Flask-Limiter. All user roles would be protected by limiting visibility and access throughout the app by excluding them from all non pertinent contexts. Sensitive information such as JWT secrets and database connection strings will be handled judiciously and encapsulated in untracked, secure modules. Marshmallow schemas and Jinja2 will be used to sanitize and validate all user input to protect against malicious code injection attacks. Cross-Site Request Forgery will be preempted by implementing flask-WTF in all user input forms. If the ACME app implements file upload the protocol will be to rename all incoming files to avoid directory traversal leading to root directory corruption. Lastly, system security requires continual foresight and care - Flask and Flask dependencies should be updated frequently to incorporate security patches and protect against evolving security threats. Continual testing of potential penetration and vulnerability risks would be implemented throughout the lifecycle of the app to ensure consistent system security and data integrity.
