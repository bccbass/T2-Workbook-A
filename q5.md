## Q5:  Provide an overview and description of a standard software testing process (e.g. manual testing)

Testing strategies are integrated into the software development process to ensure robust design. It is imperative these tests are well constructed and diverse, regardless of if they are automated or executed manually. One standard software testing process is Unit Testing. Unit tests aim to isolate smaller units of code and run it through a series of tests ensuring it is functioning as expected. Many time the targets of unit tests are functions, methods and classes. A typical software development process includes writing unit tests alongside all code being created, ideally testing all functions and methods within it. Test Driven Development takes this idea one step further by writing tests before writing production code. A testing framework is utilized to create a testing environment that can be run independently of the main program, displaying and logging all test results with detailed error messages when a test fails. Test assertions are written with hard coded arguments and are compared to known and expected outcomes. When a function or method is structured to accept user input as arguments a technique know as monkey-patching can be implemented to provide controlled arguments. Unit tests can also be structured to test that expected errors are thrown when unexpected or incorrect data is passed as an argument to the logic being tested. Generally unit tests should not cross system borders such as databases or third party software as this can become cumbersome and is better suited to higher level testing frameworks. Unit testing is a powerful tool to guide software development and isolate problems when larger systems fail.
